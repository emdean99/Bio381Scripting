Add text here. Just use it like a typewriter, and add as much or as little as you like.

New text appears here in a separate paragraph.

# First-level header

# Fencing

In line fencing with a backtick `to show anything in plain text with *no* formatting` which can be useful for many things.

In line execution of R inside the backticks by inserting R as the first element `r 3 + pi`

In line execution of R inside the backticks by inserting R as the first element `3 + pi`

3 backticks for a whole section of plain text

```
everything in here is in plain text.
even single lines.

useful especially when showing other coding instructions.

# LaTek code for equations

We set off equations with `$` for brackets.

## In-line versus stand-alone equations

These equations such as $a = 3 + 4$ will appear inside a single line of text.

These equations such as $$a = 3 + 4$$ will appear in a separate line of their own.

## Subscripts

$$H_0 = Z_{a + b}$$

## Superscripts

$$S = cA^z$$

Elements can be coupled and nested

$$S=cA^z_1 +z_{2+x}$$

## Fractions and Greek symbols

$$\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\delta + \gamma_x}$$

## Summation Signs

$$z= \sum_{i=1}^X{K}$$
## Escape the backslash with a custom term

$$\backslash \alpha \le b \backslash$$

## Rendering plaintext in a LaTex equation

$$P(occurance of Species A) = Z$$

$$P(\mbox{Occurence of species A}) = Z$$

#R in Markdown

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# Don't forget to start with comments!
# Preliminaries
library(ggplot2)

pred <- 1:10 #Vector of 10 integers
res <- runif(10) # Random Uniform Values

# Print the random numbers
print(res)

#plot the graph
qplot(x=pred,y=res)
```

Now back to writing text in our markdown document, including latex equations if we need them such as $a+b$ inserted in the middle of my sentence
